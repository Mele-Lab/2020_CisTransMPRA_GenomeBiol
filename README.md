This repository contains all of the MPRA analysis performed in this paper. Each is done in a Jupyter notebook, which contains its own description of what was done to create files/figures.

Most of the code in this repository runs on Python 3 and requires the following packages:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn

MPRA analysis runs in R and requires the MPRAnalyze package. RNA-seq analysis also runs in R and requires the DESeq2 and edgeR/limma packages.
